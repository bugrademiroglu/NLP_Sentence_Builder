# NLP_Sentence_Builder
In this project, I created new texts of 300 words for each language model by using unigram, bigram and trigram language models according to the information in the text file received from the user and using their probabilities.

First of all, you must have Python3 installed on your computer.

1-)Install the NLTK library for Python installed on your system via the terminal.

2-)Install the Pandas library for Python installed on your system via the terminal.

3-)To do this, you can run the following code on your terminal.

python -m pip install nltk
python -m pip install pandas
4-)After completing these steps, take the main.py file from github.

5-)Prepare a txt file. This could be the speeches of a celebrity or a politician or even a movie character.

6-)Run the project with the command python3 main.py "path to .txt file".

7-)In the "path to .txt file" section, you need to enter the location of the your text file. For example / Users / user / Desktop / NLPFolder
